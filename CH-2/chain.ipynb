      "API KEY VARAIBLE EXIST\n",
      "Short answer\n",
      "A blockchain is a shared, tamper-resistant digital ledger that records transactions in a way that many computers agree on. Once something is added, it’s very hard to change, and everyone with access can see the same history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Simple analogy\n",
      "- Think of a blockchain like a public notebook that everyone can copy. Whenever people agree a page is correct, it’s glued into a binder. Everyone replaces their old notebook with the new glued binder, so all copies stay the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "How it works (step-by-step, simply)\n",
      "1. Someone creates a transaction (e.g., Alice sends 1 coin to Bob).\n",
      "2. That transaction is broadcast to a network of computers (nodes).\n",
      "3. Nodes check the transaction is valid (Alice has the coin and the signature is correct).\n",
      "4. Valid transactions are grouped into a “block” (like a page in the notebook).\n",
      "5. The network uses a process (consensus) to agree which block is added next. Different systems do this differently (examples: proof-of-work or proof-of-stake).\n",
      "6. Once agreed, the block is added to the end of the chain, and every node updates its copy of the ledger.\n",
      "7. Because each block links to the previous block (with a cryptographic “fingerprint”), changing any past entry would be obvious and very difficult.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key properties\n",
      "- Decentralized: No single company controls the ledger; many participants keep copies.\n",
      "- Transparent: Anyone with permission can see the history of transactions.\n",
      "- Immutable (hard to change): Blocks link to each other cryptographically, so tampering is difficult.\n",
      "- Secure: Cryptography and consensus make fake transactions hard to get accepted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Common uses\n",
      "- Cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ether)\n",
      "- Smart contracts (self-executing rules)\n",
      "- Supply-chain tracking, digital identity, voting systems (experimental/varies by implementation)\n",
      "\n",
      "Limitations and cautions\n",
      "- Not magically private: public blockchains are visible to everyone; sensitive data should be handled carefully.\n",
      "- Irreversible: mistakes or stolen funds can be hard or impossible to reverse.\n",
      "- Scalability and speed: many blockchains are slower/less efficient than centralized databases.\n",
      "- Energy: some consensus methods (like Bitcoin’s proof-of-work) use lots of electricity.\n",
      "- Still a developing technology with legal and security challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want, I can:\n",
      "- Give a one-paragraph non-technical summary to share with others.\n",
      "- Compare public vs. private blockchains.\n",
      "- Explain proof-of-work vs. proof-of-stake in simple terms.\n"

      "   - If COVID‑19 positive and patient is at high risk for progression, contact clinician promptly about antiviral options (e.g., nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) — treatment-window and eligibility criteria apply.\n",

      "- Goal of HIV treatment: suppress plasma HIV RNA to “undetectable” and keep it there (prevents disease progression and stops sexual transmission).\n",
      "- Recommendation: start antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all people with HIV as soon as possible after diagnosis (same‑day start often appropriate) unless there is a clear reason to delay.\n",
      "- Choice of regimen is individualized by prior ART exposure, baseline viral load, CD4 count, resistance test results, coinfections (HBV, TB), pregnancy or pregnancy potential, drug interactions, kidney/hepatic function, and patient preference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Baseline tests before or at ART start\n",
      "- HIV RNA (viral load) and CD4 count\n",
      "- HIV genotype (resistance) test if possible (guides regimen choice)\n",
      "- Hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B surface antibody, hepatitis C antibody/RNA\n",
      "- HLA‑B*5701 (if abacavir is considered)\n",
      "- Pregnancy test for people who can be pregnant\n",
      "- Renal function (creatinine, eGFR), liver tests, fasting lipids and glucose\n",
      "- STI screening and baseline vaccinations as indicated\n",
      "\n",
      "Preferred first‑line options (commonly used)\n",
      "- An INSTI‑based single‑tablet regimen is preferred for most adults because of potency, tolerability and high barrier to resistance:\n",
      "  - Bictegravir/tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine (Biktarvy) — widely used first line\n",
      "  - Dolutegravir + tenofovir alafenamide or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + lamivudine or emtricitabine (examples: Tivicay + Descovy/Truvada; or Triumeq if abacavir eligible)\n",
      "- Dual‑therapy option in selected treatment‑naïve patients:\n",
      "  - Dolutegravir + lamivudine (Dovato) — for people without HBV coinfection and when resistance tests/clinical situation allow\n",
      "- Long‑acting injectable maintenance (for patients already virologically suppressed and meeting criteria):\n",
      "  - Intramuscular cabotegravir + rilpivirine (Cabenuva) every 4 or 8 weeks\n",
      "\n",
      "Key considerations and special situations\n",
      "- HLA‑B*5701 positive → avoid abacavir-containing regimens (risk of hypersensitivity).\n",
      "- HBV coinfection → use a regimen active against HBV (tenofovir + lamivudine or emtricitabine as part of ART).\n",
      "- Pregnancy or trying to conceive → current guidance supports dolutegravir‑based regimens at any time in pregnancy; tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) + emtricitabine/lamivudine is commonly used. Discuss risks/benefits with obstetric and HIV clinicians.\n",
      "- Tuberculosis (rifampin) → many interactions with ART (rifampin can reduce levels of most INSTIs and NNRTIs); dosing adjustments or alternate agents may be needed; coordinate HIV–TB treatment closely.\n",
      "- Renal impairment → TAF preferred over TDF in people with reduced renal function (but check eGFR thresholds); some agents require dose modification or avoidance.\n",
      "- Drug–drug interactions → check interactions with common drugs (statins, anticonvulsants, rifamycins, acid suppressants, hormonal contraception). Use an interaction checker or consult a pharmacist.\n",
      "\n",
      "When resistance or treatment‑experience limits options\n",
      "- For people with virologic failure or multi‑drug resistance, regimens are chosen based on resistance testing. Options may include:\n",
      "  - Boosted protease inhibitor‑based regimens (darunavir + ritonavir/cobicistat) combined with active NRTIs or novel agents\n",
      "  - Newer agents for heavily treatment‑experienced patients: fostemsavir, ibalizumab, lenacapavir (use under specialist care)\n",
      "- Always involve an HIV specialist for salvage therapy planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monitoring after starting ART\n",
      "- Viral load: check ~2–4 weeks after start if possible, then at 4–8 weeks and every 3 months until suppressed; once suppressed, every 3–6 months.\n",
      "- CD4: baseline and repeated as indicated (every 3 months until stable and then less often if >200).\n",
      "- Renal and liver function, lipids, glucose periodically based on the regimen and comorbidities.\n",
      "- Adherence assessment and adverse effects monitoring at each visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prevention and supportive care\n",
      "- Ongoing counseling about adherence, safer sex, and partner notification/testing.\n",
      "- Vaccinations per schedule (influenza, pneumococcus, hepatitis A/B if susceptible, HPV, Tdap).\n",
      "- Prophylaxis for opportunistic infections (e.g., TMP‑SMX for PCP when CD4 <200; toxoplasmosis prophylaxis when IgG+ and CD4 <100; MAC prophylaxis rarely needed if ART started promptly).\n",
      "- Offer partner services and consider PrEP for HIV‑negative partners.\n",
      "\n",
      "Practical points for patients\n",
      "- Take ART exactly as prescribed — missing doses increases risk of resistance.\n",
      "- Expect possible early side effects (nausea, headache, sleep changes) that often improve; report severe or persistent problems.\n",
      "- If you have other medications or supplements, check for interactions before changing anything.\n",
      "- Keep follow‑up appointments and lab monitoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "When to seek urgent care\n",
      "- New neurologic symptoms, severe abdominal pain, jaundice, signs of severe allergic reaction (rash, fever, facial swelling), or symptoms of opportunistic infections — seek immediate medical attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next steps\n",
      "- If you or someone you care for has newly diagnosed HIV, arrange linkage to an HIV clinic or provider ASAP for baseline testing and to begin ART (same‑day start when feasible).\n",
